# Task10_Lvl01-Capstone02

task15_game.py is a Python file which allows the user to play a game in which he/she moves the player object so as not to collide with enemy objects, while trying to capture the prize object.

## Functions
The user can move the player object up and down as well as right and left to avoid enemy objects. If the user does collide into one of the enemy objects, the game is over and the user loses the game.

If the user has avoided all of the enemy objects and/or captures the prize object, the user wins the game.

## Use
The program is useful for entertainment purposes for ages 5 and up. It is a lightweight game, which only requires 415KB of free space. 

## Contributors
The original game was created by HyperionDev. This version included the functionality to move the player object up an down with only 1 enemy object. 

The functionality was then updated and extended by Nadia Botha. Please send an email to nadiamarais@live.co.za regarding any issues. Include a brief description and screenshot of the issue in the email, with Task 15 Game as the email subject.
